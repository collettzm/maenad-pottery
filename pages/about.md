## About the Collection

This is a collection of images of pottery depicting maenads, bacchae, or bacchantes, the namesake of the play <i>The Bacchae</i> by Euripides, one of the most popular ancient Greek tragedies. The collection spans 150 years, 520 BCE - 380 BCE, and contains pieces from three different countries. Unfortunately, Greece is not one of them. I was unable to find a museum in Greece which publishes images of the pottery in its collection. However, this collection does not endorse any theft or other unsavory methods by which these museums obtained their pieces. The museums from which the images in this collection come are the Yale University Art Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, and the J. Paul Getty Museum (see links below). 

The hope is that these images can educate people at any level on the depiction of maenads around the time that Eurpides would have written <i>The Bacchae</i>. The collection may also be considered in the broader context of Greek mythology, featuring depictions of one of the many figures featured in that mythos. While each piece is accompanied by sufficient information for the lay person, including a link to the catalog record from the museum in which the piece is housed, each piece also has at least one scholarly citation to assist those doing research.
